## Introduce yourself

#### I'm just an ordinary boy who is not tech-savvy, touches the computer for the first time to play CF at your house and likes the game's hack software. After watching all the great hacker movies, I started dreaming of becoming a Hacker. Gone are some useless courses and bad youtube videos that teach how to hack. People tell me I'm an idiot who doesn't even know how to reinstall windows.

It's one thing to question your mind; it's another to question your eyes and ears. 
But, then again, isn't it all the same? Our senses just mediocre inputs to our brain? 
Sure, we rely on them, trust they accurately portray the real world around us, but what 
if the haunting truth is they can't? That what we perceive isn't the real world at all, 
but just our mind's best guess? That all we really have is a garbled reality, a truly 
fuzzy picture we will never make out

## End
#### Not only am I stupid; it's that I'm just smart enough to know how stupid I am. So I need to work harder than others.
